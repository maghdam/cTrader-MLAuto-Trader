Regime/Momentum Gate (optional)
================================

You can optionally gate live executions by a simple regime/momentum metric generated by the feature pipeline.
When enabled, the live trader will:

- Allow LONG only if the regime metric is positive (or non‑negative if non‑strict).
- Allow SHORT only if the regime metric is negative (or non‑positive if non‑strict).

Environment flags
-----------------

```
# Enable/disable gating
GATE_BY_REGIME=0            # 1 to enable, 0 to disable (default 0)

# Which feature column to use as the regime source
GATE_SOURCE=market_regime   # or kama_trend (must exist in features)

# Strictness of the check
GATE_STRICT=1               # 1: >0 / <0, 0: >=0 / <=0
```

Notes
-----
- `market_regime` and `kama_trend` are produced by `src/feature_engineering.py::add_core_features`.
- Gating is applied before placing non‑flat orders and is logged. If Notion journaling is enabled, a `REGIME_BLOCK` event is recorded.
